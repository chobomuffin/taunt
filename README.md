taunt
=====

Need your computer to hurl abuse at you? Broke the build? Dude walked in everyone hates? use this gem to TAUNT

Basically plays whatever sounds you dump into ~/.taunt at random whenever you execute `taunt`

Oh, only works on OS X so far (feel free to patch if you want Windows/Linux/whatever support)

Hate it? Hit me up on [@madlep](http://twitter.com/#!/madlep) or spam me on [julian.doherty.ml@gmail.com](mailto:julian.doherty.ml@gmail.com)
