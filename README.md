taunt
=====

Need your computer to hurl abuse at you? Broke the build? Dude walked in everyone hates?  
Use this gem to TAUNT!

Plays whatever sounds you dump into `~/.taunt` at random whenever you execute `taunt`

Hate it? Hit me up on [@madlep](http://twitter.com/#!/madlep) or spam me on [julian.doherty.ml@gmail.com](mailto:julian.doherty.ml@gmail.com)

Usage
-----
    > gem install taunt

Then to play whatever you've dumped into `~/.taunt/` (it'll search recursively, so subdirs are fine)

    > taunt
    
Alternatively, just supply an argument if you want to play from a different directory

    > taunt ~/my_sounds/tf2/cool_stuff_heavy_says/

Todo
----
- Only works on OS X so far (feel free to patch if you want Windows/Linux/whatever support)
